## How to run ?

First, you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

If you're using the Docker CLI, you'll need to configure its user groups and permissions before continuing. I recommend searching tutorials for installing & configuring the Docker CLI for your OS

For development purposes, run the Docker container in watch mode : 

**_CLI :_**
```sh
cd path/to/repo
docker compose up --watch
```

**_GUI :_**
